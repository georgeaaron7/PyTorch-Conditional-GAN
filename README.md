# PyTorch-Conditional-GAN

- Conditional Generative Adverarial Networks are a type of GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) where output generation is controlled by a specific condition
- This conditioning enables more precise and targeted data generation.
- Generator combines both noise and condition info to create synthetic images which are then passed to the discriminator to figure out if the image is real or fake.
- Discriminator tries to increase it's ability to find fakes and Generator does opposite, it tries to reduce it's ability of getting caught.
