# PyTorch-Conditional-GAN

- Unlike standard GANs, CGANS receives a class label(condition) along with a random noise vector. In this project, it is some particular clothing garment in the dataset. 
- Generator combines both noise and condition info to create synthetic images which are then passed to the discriminator to figure out if the image is real or fake.
- Discriminator tries to increase it's ability to find fakes and Generator does opposite, it tries to reduce it's ability of getting caught.
